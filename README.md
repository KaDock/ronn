Docker Container of Ronn

Ronn builds manuals. It converts simple, human readable textfiles to roff for terminal display, and also to HTML for the web.

The source format includes all of Markdown but has a more rigid structure and syntax extensions for features commonly found in manpages (definition lists, link notation, etc.). The ronn-format(7) manual page defines the format in detail.
